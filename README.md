A browser-based graphical user interface for interactive exploratory data analysis, 
powered by the 'gg1d' package. 
Designed for non-programmers, it allows users to explore complex multi-variable relationships, 
visualize patterns of missing data, and create publication-ready parallel coordinate plots 
and tiled one-dimensional graphics â€” all without writing a single line of code.

## Quick Start

Start using the web-app hosted [here](https://CCICB.github.io/ggEDA)


### Running ggEDA offline:

You can install ggEDA as an R package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("CCICB/ggEDA")
```

Once installed, run the app locally:

``` r
library(ggEDA)
run_app()
```

ggEDA will open in your default browser.
